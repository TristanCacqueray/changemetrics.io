title: About

The main idea behind Monocle is to detect anomalies in the way changes
are produced in your project on GitHub and Gerrit.
Each team is unique in its way of working: how to do code reviews, how
many reviewers, how to do CI, is self merge allowed...

So the philosophy behind Monocle is to let you visualize and explore
metrics and data that are relevant to the way you work by navigating
and filtering in the web user interface.
