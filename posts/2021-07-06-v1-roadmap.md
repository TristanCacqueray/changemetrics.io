title: Version 1.0 Roadmap
---

We recently introduced:

- A new API using protobuf,
- A new query syntax to enable complex filtering, and,
- Three new crawlers using a new streaming based framework.

Here is a roadmap to consolidate and stabilize the new features:
[1.0 Milestone](https://github.com/change-metrics/monocle/milestone/9).
The goal is to cleanup the legacy left-overs so that further
updates are less disruptif.

This will lay down a solid fondation for upcoming enhancements:
[Next Milestone](https://github.com/change-metrics/monocle/milestone/10).

Feel free to get in touch if you are interested, you can join us in this
Matrix room at [#monocle:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#monocle:matrix.org).
