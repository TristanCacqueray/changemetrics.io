title: Version 1.6.0 Release
---

We are pleased to announce a new release of Monocle.

This release mainly features a user authentication system and removes the need to
use a httpd server to host static assets like the web application.

With this release Monocle can be configured to authenticate user via an Identity
provider supporting OpenID Connect. Authentication can be set to be optional or
mandatory. Authenticated users with a matching Monocle Identity benefit
personalized content.

The compose file no longer setup the `web` container as static assets are
served directly via the Monocle api service.

Compose variables have been prefixed by COMPOSE_* so you might need to
update your `.env` file.

Here are instructions to upgrade to 1.6.0:

```Shell
cd monocle

# Stop the previous running version
docker-compose stop
docker-compose rm

# Checkout the tag 1.6.0
git fetch origin
git checkout -b 1.6.0 1.6.0

# Ensure to set COMPOSE_MONOCLE_VERSION=1.6.0 in .env file
sed -i .env -e "/MONOCLE_VERSION=.*/ d"
echo "COMPOSE_MONOCLE_VERSION=1.6.0" >> .env

# Fetch last images
docker-compose pull

# Spawn services
docker-compose up -d
```
