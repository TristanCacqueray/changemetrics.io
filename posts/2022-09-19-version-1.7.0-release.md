title: Version 1.7.0 Release
---

We are pleased to announce a new release of Monocle.

This release mainly features a new metric catalog where each individual metric
can be computed from the Monocle WEB UI. Each metric page provides the metric's value,
trend, and top if applicable. [See catalog on the demo node.](https://demo.changemetrics.io/ansible/metrics)

Furthermore a support for the 'ttm' field in the query language has been added. It
allows to filter on merged changes of a specific duration (in seconds).

Finally, the k8s deployment is now officially supported and fully documented in the
project's README.md.

See the changelog to checkout other changes.

Here are instructions to upgrade to 1.7.0:

```Bash
cd monocle

# Stop the previous running version
docker-compose down

# Checkout the tag 1.7.0
git fetch origin
git checkout -b 1.7.0 1.7.0

# Ensure to set COMPOSE_MONOCLE_VERSION=1.7.0 in .env file
sed -i .env -e "/MONOCLE_VERSION=.*/ d"
echo "COMPOSE_MONOCLE_VERSION=1.7.0" >> .env

# Fetch last images
docker-compose pull

# Spawn services
docker-compose up -d
```
