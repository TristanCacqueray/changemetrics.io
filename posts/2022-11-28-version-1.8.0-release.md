title: Version 1.8.0 Release
---

We are pleased to announce a new release of Monocle.

This release mainly features two new board features:

- The **pin** change button which make the change to appear highlighted. This is
  handy when you have some changes that you'd like follow carefully.
- The **mask** change button which prevent a change to appear anymore in
  the board. The usage is for *do not merged*, *testing CI* changes.

Furthermore, this release brings a better support for the *draft/wip*
changes. The Gerrit support has been fixed and *draft/wip* changes can be filtered by
adding **state:draft** to your Monocle query.

See the full [changelog](https://github.com/change-metrics/monocle/blob/1.8.0/CHANGELOG.md) for
the complete list of changes.

Here are instructions to upgrade to 1.8.0:

```Bash
cd monocle

# Stop the previous running version
docker-compose down

# Checkout the tag 1.8.0
git fetch origin
git checkout -b 1.8.0 1.8.0

# Ensure to set COMPOSE_MONOCLE_VERSION=1.8.0 in .env file
sed -i .env -e "/COMPOSE_MONOCLE_VERSION=.*/ d"
echo "COMPOSE_MONOCLE_VERSION=1.8.0" >> .env

# Fetch last images
