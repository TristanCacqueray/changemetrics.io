title: Version 1.4.0 Release
---

We are pleased to announce a new release of Monocle.

This release mainly removes a technical dept where the GitHub Pull-Requests crawler
was managed differently than other crawlers. With this release, the crawler is managed
by the same process (or container) than other crawlers and respects the same API.
Note this change should be transparent as it does not require changes in the Monocle
configuration or database schema updates.

Other notables changes:

- A minimal login capability to enable the use 'self' keyword in queries has been added.

Here is the instruction to upgrade to 1.4.0:

```Shell
cd monocle

# Stop the previous running version
docker-compose stop
docker-compose rm

# Checkout last master
git pull origin master

# Fetch last images
docker-compose pull

# Spawn services
docker-compose up -d
```

the [backlog](https://github.com/change-metrics/monocle/issues) for what's coming next.
