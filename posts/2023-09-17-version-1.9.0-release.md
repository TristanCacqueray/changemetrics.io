title: Version 1.9.0 Release
---

We are pleased to announce a new release of Monocle.

Beside being mainly a maintainance release, it features:

- A change in the Peer strength metric computation to enable filtering by change author.
- A CLI command to wipe any data created by a Crawler.
- A new global crawler setting to set the loop delay in second (`loop_delay_sec`).

See the full [changelog](https://github.com/change-metrics/monocle/blob/1.9.0/CHANGELOG.md) for
the complete list of changes.

Here are instructions to upgrade:

```Bash
cd monocle

# Stop the previous running version
docker-compose down

# Checkout the tag 1.9.0
git fetch origin
git checkout -b 1.9.0 1.9.0

# Ensure to set COMPOSE_MONOCLE_VERSION=1.9.0 in .env file
sed -i .env -e "/COMPOSE_MONOCLE_VERSION=.*/ d"
echo "COMPOSE_MONOCLE_VERSION=1.9.0" >> .env

# Fetch last images
docker-compose pull

# Spawn services
docker-compose up -d
```
