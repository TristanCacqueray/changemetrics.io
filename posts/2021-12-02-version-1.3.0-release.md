title: Version 1.3.0 Release
---

We are pleased to announce a new release of Monocle:

Here is a summary of notable changes:

- Board and Changes viewes got a new toggle that can be used to show or hide changes.
  This feature is handy to quickly hide a change you just reviewed. When the change is updated
  (a new comment, or code change, ...) it appears again.
- The Board is easier to configure as columns can be reordered.
- The UX got some improvments to improve usability.

See the full [changelog](https://github.com/change-metrics/monocle/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and
the [backlog](https://github.com/change-metrics/monocle/issues) for what's coming next.
