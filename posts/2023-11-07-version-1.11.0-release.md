We are pleased to announce a new release of Monocle.

The release features:

- A support of the Proxy HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environments for the crawler requests.
- An improved handling of errors that are no longer fatal and they are now stored in the index.
- The last version of Elasticsearch 7.17.16.

It also fixes the UI search feature that was broken in the previous Monocle version.
